Markup
=======

A markup language is distinct from a programming lanuage because a markup language is primarily used to define
the structure and formatting of a document. In other words, a document's markup language defines how the
document is rendered after it has been processed. What markup languages share in common with programming
languages is that both can define the relationship between an object (app/document) and it's various parts,
and both can define how objects are linked and related to one another. 

Perhaps the most commonly used and known markup language is HTML, which stands for Hyper Textual Markup
Language. Other examples of commonly used markup languages are XML, CSS, SASS, LATEX, markdown, Restructured
Textual Markup Language, and MSDocs.
