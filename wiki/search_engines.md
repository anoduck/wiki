Search Engines
===============

A search engine searches an index of webpages for a desired word or phrase the webpage possesses significant
authority upon. (Could have been written better.)

This entry was created for the sake of taxonomy.

Search Engine Optimization
--------------------------

As one can easily deduce, search engine optimization is the process of optimizing one's website to be more
easily parsed by search engine crawlers. This is because the easier it is for the crawler to parse your site,
the higher your site will be placed in search engine results, and the higher your site is placed in search
engine results, the more visitors you will have to your website. It is as simple as that.

### Submitting your site to a search engine

Every search engine is a little different when it comes to submitting your site, unquestionably Google still
remains the most important search engine to submit your site too, also unquestionably it is the most difficult
and irritating experience of them all. Duckduckgo, who unquestionably provide bias and filtered search
results, does not even possess a formal means for site submission. While Yandex and Bing can both be done with
the same basic steps.

#### IndexNow

A few months back from when this entry was written, Microsoft was pushing a new standardized method of
website submission for their search engine Bing. It now appears they are still supporting this methodology,
but their exuberance for adoption has come to an end. Which is probably because it was too damn good of an
idea for them to support. This methodology was called [IndexNow](https://www.bing.com/indexnow), and once configured it
will not only submit your site to Bing, but it will submit your site to Yandex as well. The steps for setting
it up were quite easy. Please use the link below to learn how to set it up for now.

#### Google

In order to submit your site to Google for it to be indexed for search results, you first will have to verify
you are the owner of your site. In order to do this you have to go through the process of site verification,
which will entail modifying your dns records.

Once your site is verified, only then can you register your site for submission. Once registered you then will
have to submit your `sitemap.xml` to google for crawling. It will take google several days to get around to
crawling your site the first time. Once your site is crawled, google will then generate an error report which
will tell you why it could not crawl the majority of your webpages. It is here where our next entry in the
wiki begins.

Meta Search Engines
--------------------

A meta search engine searches a defined set of search engines for the results of a word or phrase. So, a meta search engine is a search engine for other search
engines.
