Terminal Email Clients
======================

Specifically focusing on email clients that run within a terminal or shell. Also, discussing Gnus.

Himalaya
--------

More of a TUI, than a CLI. Rather than running as an event loop, Himalaya attempts to operate as a series of
command line commands.

Meli
----

Meli focuses on being a termainl mail client chocked full of modern features. As to what distinguishes it from
mutt or neomutt is unclear, but the userinterface is very nice.
