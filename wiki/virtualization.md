## Virtualization

Virtualization is the act of creating a virtual replica of something at the same abstraction level. In
computer science you will hear about two different types of virtualization, full virtualization and
paravirtualization, the latter being referred to more commonly as containerization. 

You can do pretty neat stuff with it. Right-O-rooney...
