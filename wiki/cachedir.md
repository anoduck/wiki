CACHEDIR.TAG
============

TL;DR: There is a reason both the title and the figlet are both capitalized, and that is the file label also needs to
be capitalized, and include `Signature: 8a477f597d28d172789f06886806bc55`.

Bryan Ford, proposed that directories who primary purpose is to store cache should include a "special" tag
file which identifies them as cache directories. He mentions his reasons for this, and the file format in
detail [HERE](https://bford.info/cachedir/)
