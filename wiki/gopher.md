The Gopher Protocol
===================

Similar to WWW, Gopher is a protocol for delivering and transfering information from one host to another.
Despite remaining almost completely unknown to popular culture, Gopher is nearly as old as WWW is, but
despite this maturity, Gopher does not provide the same graphically focused features.

Recently, Gopher has seen a resurgence in popularity, and the number of gopher sites is increasing.
