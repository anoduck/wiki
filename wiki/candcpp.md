Programming Notes
------------------

### Static Keyword

When anything is declared as a `static` type it indicates that the item possesses a unique characteristic of permanence. What this
characteristic means is dependent on what the item is. 

* static variables - have a memory space dedicated to them for the duration of the program.
* static data member in a class - are shared by other objects in that class.
* static member functions - are not dependent on the object class, and are only allowed to access static data members or other static member functions.
* global static variables - similar to regular global variables, except they are only accessible from within the file it is defined.
