## Welcome to the rest of your life.

One does not simply install Emacs. Creating an Emacs configuration file is a process that will take the rest
of your remaining life, and you still will have not completed it. Instead of set and done, think of it as a
process of continual maintenance.

Busey ipsum dolor sit amet. Go with the feeling of the nature. Take it easy. Know why you're here. And remember
to balance your internal energy with the environment.You ever roasted doughnuts?Have you urinated? Have you 
drained your bladder? Are you free? Because if you haven't it will only come out later. I'm giving you some
information that your bodily fluids may penetrate your clothing fibre's without warning.

You ever roasted doughnuts?It's good to yell at people and tell people that you're from Tennesee, so that way 
you'll be safe.I wrestled a bear once. A 750lbs black bear.Have you urinated? Have you drained your bladder?
Are you free? Because if you haven't it will only come out later. I'm giving you some information that your

The best way to communicate is compatible. Compatible communication is listening with open ears and an open mind,
and not being fearful or judgemental about what you're hearing.Listen to the silence. And when the silence is 
deafening, you're in the center of your own universe.

### Good place to start

Below are two links from the emacswiki. Both include snippets or oneliners that are convenient, commonly
used, and encouraged to include in your init file.

* [EmacsCrashCode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsCrashCode)

### For the impatient

For those of us who possess a propensity of impatience. Here is an example of an `init.el` file written by
someone who knows what they are doing. (Not, me.) 

[Exemplary Init](exemp_init)

### The most important snippet of code in your entire new life

Don't ask me where I found this, probably from the [emacswiki](https://emacswiki.org), but it's value cannot
be quantified by modern man, and it will save you days of painstaking labor. Add it to your init for instant
relief, and calmness will flow through your body. (Boy, that was worded awkwardly...)

```elisp
(setq
   backup-by-copying t      ; don't clobber symlinks
   backup-directory-alist
    '(("." . "~/.saves"))    ; don't litter my fs tree
   delete-old-versions t
   kept-new-versions 6
   kept-old-versions 2
   version-control t)
```

Now, you are ready to tackle the world being a better man because of it.

### Use-Package

Use-package is a package for emacs, that allows you to easily load and configure other packages for your Emacs session. For
lack of a better explanation, it is sort of like "nix config" for emacs, except not at all.

The documentation for it is fairly extensive, and best if left to the author to maintain. So, here is a direct
link to the readme. [Use-Package Readme](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/blob/master/README.md)

#### Most Commonly used Keywords.

| Keyword        | Definition                                                       | Load Time | example                              |

##### Examples

###### General

General uses two methods for setting keymaps. 
1. Global
2. Per Mode

```elisp
;; Global
:general
("C-x f" 'find-file)

;; Keymap by mode
:general
(:keymap org-mode-map
  ("C-c a" org-agenda))
```


##### syntactical format

In the following example, `$package` will be used to represent a desired package.

```elisp
(use-package $package
   :requires $another-package
	 :defer t
	 )
```

### Giving Emacs a boost

After reading an article on [emacswiki](https://emacswiki.com) I learned it is recommended to bump your
single file memory limit to 1GB. Therefore, I added.

```elisp
(setq most-positive-fixnum 1073741824)
```
