# Hyper Textual Protocol

Here should go some fancy explanation as to what HTTP is.

## HTTP Methods

Request methods indicate the purpose of the requests and what is expected in return if the request is
successful.

1. POST - submits something to the specified resource, often causing a change in server state.
2. PUT - Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request content.
3. GET - Requests a representation of the specified resource. Should not contain request content.
4. DELETE - deletes the specified resource.
5. HEAD - Asks for an identical response to a GET request, but without a response body.
6. CONNECT - Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
7. OPTIONS - describes communication options for the target resource.
8. TRACE - performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
9. PATCH - applies partial modifications to a resource.
