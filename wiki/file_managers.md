File Managers
==============

> File Managers & File Browsers are synonamous with one another. They are one of the most essential parts of
> any Operating System. While you can do everything in the shell, File Managers just make it easy.

## Overview of Options

These days file managers are a dime a dozen, while some stand apart because of their incredible design and ease of use, others exist in
popularity due to being a long standing staple of the genre, but several provide an interesting perspective to the commonly used
application. Here we will attempt to addresssome file managers that meet the above mentioned features.

* ytree: is a file manager inspired by DOS's tree file manager
* midnight commander (mc): is probably the most popular and common of this group. An old standard, and a flat
	out damn good file manager. Available for every distrobution I have encountered anyway. Provides the classic
	double panel interface.
* ranger: is another old standard file manager that has acquired much popularity over the years. Provides a
	framed layout that enables the user to preview both files and direcories.
* broot: Is a new take on the entire file manager genre. In fact, it doesn't refer to itself as a file
	manager, but rather a more extensive version of `ls`.
* clifm: is a "blows the hair off of your head" fast filemanager for linux and unix systems. It is
	lightweight, incredibly well programmed, and extremely intuitive to use. Packed with features as well.
* nnn: is a lightweight fully customizable file manager for linux and unix terminals. It has quite a large
	following, but requires customization before really usable.
* lf: is a new feature packed file manager modeled after the famous ranger file manager. It's response time
	is fast, and use comes rather easily.
* lfm: is another file manager modeled after ranger written in python.
* vifm: A file manager for those who are absolutely in love with VIM.
* deer: A super lightweight file manager to be run directly in the console. Not as feature packed as many of
	the aforementioned file managers here, but what it lacks in features, it makes up for in convenience. As it
	is intended to be toggled with a single keystroke for fast file administration.
* bbb: Is a file manager completely written in bash, and as such it is lightweight and fast.
