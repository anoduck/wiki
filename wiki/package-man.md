Package Managers
================

Package managers are applications that help the user manage and maintain software of their operating system.
Those who are new to the world of computing or come from a windows / macintosh background will be unfamiliar
with the concept, since both Operating Systems do not rely on package managers as heavily as Unix and Linux
based systems do. Package Managers are created by the developers of the Operating System, and usually provide
nearly everything a user could desire. 

Nearly all Operating Systems use a different package manager to manage the software of their operating system
distribution. While it is impossible to list every package manager available we can name some of the more
popular ones.
