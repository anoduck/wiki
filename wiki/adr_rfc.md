Architectual Decision Records and Request For Comments
=======================================================

> The most important thing about ADRs and RFCs is what makes them different, and when their use is
> appropraite. While most of us have heard of RFCs, ADRs are more commonly applicable, and do not require
> communal concensus. ADRs record a decision that was made, sets a standard, or defines a precedence. RFCs
> record communal concensus toward change.
